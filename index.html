<h2 class="title">SUN</h2>


<p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,[18][19] heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. <span class="mark">The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation.</span> the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>

<h3 class="title">SUNLIGHT</h3>

<p>Sunlight is a portion of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the Sun, in particular infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. On Earth, sunlight is scattered and filtered through Earth's atmosphere, and is obvious as daylight when the Sun is above the horizon.</p>

<span>When direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as sunshine,a combination of bright light and radiant heat.</span>

<h4 class="title">SUNSET</h4>

<p>Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As viewed from everywhere on Earth (except the North and South poles), the equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the Spring and Autumn equinox. As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the Northern hemisphere's spring and summer, and to the southwest in the</p>

<h5 class="title">MOON</h5>

<p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its diameter is about one-quarter the diameter of the Earth (comparable to the width of Australia).[16] The Moon is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System. It is larger than any of the known dwarf planets and is the largest (and most massive) satellite relative to its parent planet.[f]  Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.</p>
<span>The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[17] It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g).</span>

<h6 class="title">MOONLIGHT</h6>

<p>Moonlight is literally the light we can see shining from the moon, but to moonlight is to work a second job. Get it? You have to work in the moonlight because there aren't enough hours in the day. Moonlight is the reflection of the sun off the moon's surface â€” a clear sky and a full moon provide brilliant moonlight.</p>
